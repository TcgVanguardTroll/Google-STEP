        <p> Hi, my name is Jordan Grant and I'm currently a rising junior at 
            the University at Buffalo ! My major is computer science with a minor in linguistics
            and some of my hobbies as of recent include learning russian as well as writing personal stories. .
        </p>
        <p> I am a 2x STEP intern. Last Summer I worked on the Frameworks web team where I worked alongside 
            my podmate to work to  create an internal debugging tool for internal google web
            frameworks in the Google SunnyVale office. Althoguh this was my first real Work experience
            It cemented my interests in computer science and the memeories I made over that summer were
            unforgettable.
        </p>
        <p>
           Althoguh I'm only a Rising Junior nor as well as the fcat that I'm nowhere near the smartest person
           I know, I want this page to represent my progress as I grow. Becuase I want to share with the world
          all the places that I will go.
